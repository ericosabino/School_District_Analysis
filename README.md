#Overview of the school district analysis: Explain the purpose of this analysis.

##The Analysis and the change
The initial analysis coveered the performance of the students in various dimensions. After it was discovered that the Thomas School students had their scores altered, the analysis was redone by resetting scores for the 9th grade students to null.

After that the tables was regenerated, and the comparison of the data before and after this adjustment will be shown below.
