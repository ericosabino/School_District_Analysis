# School_District_Analysis

# Overview of the school district analysis: Explain the purpose of this analysis.

## The Analysis and the change
The initial analysis coveered the performance of the students in various dimensions. After it was discovered that the Thomas School students of the 9th grades had their scores altered, the analysis was redone by resetting scores for the 9th grade students to null.

The new tables were generated and the comparison between previous analysis and the current one is found below.
